                Hello, everyone! I am thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is J. Uday Kiran, and I am a motivated individual with a passion for learning and a drive to excel in the world of technology.

                I completed my B-Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the esteemed Mother Teresa Institute of Science and Technology in 2022, where I achieved a CGPA of 7.0. Prior to that, I successfully completed my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering with a CGPA of 7.6. These educational experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills.
                
                During my academic journey, I undertook some remarkable projects that allowed me to showcase my innovative mindset and technical expertise. One notable project was the design of a hydraulic ladder, aimed at enabling effortless access to elevated heights. Additionally, I took on the challenge of developing a four-wheel vehicle with reverse gear mechanism, integrating a counter gear mechanism to provide seamless reverse motion. Moreover, I developed an appointment application, a responsive web page facilitating dynamic communication between doctors and patients.
                
                In terms of achievements, I am proud to have received the Lead India certificate and secured the second prize in a PPT competition at KLR. To further enhance my skills, I obtained a Core Java certification from HACKER RANK and attended a bootcamp on CSS from Codekaro. These experiences have broadened my knowledge and sharpened my abilities in programming languages, such as Java, as well as database management with MySQL and web development using HTML and CSS. I am proficient in working with tools like Eclipse IDE and Visual Studio.
                
                Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid movie enthusiast, finding inspiration in the power of storytelling. I am also deeply passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest tools and technologies, as I believe that continuous learning is essential for personal growth and success in the ever-evolving field of technology.
                
                With a firm commitment to self-improvement and a thirst for knowledge, I am eager to embark on new challenges and contribute my skills to a reputed organization. I believe that this opportunity will enable me to expand my horizons, learn new skills, and make a meaningful impact. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to connecting with all of you!
